        The <strong>Clone</strong> feature allows you to create a copy of another user's document
        in your own workspace. The copy includes all the annotations from the original, but 
        is otherwise independent from the source. Think of cloning as a way to build on the work 
        that other users have created and shared, without the risk of breaking or interfering with
        anything.

      <h2>How to Clone</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit another user's workspace, you will see a list of documents that this user has:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>declared to be under an open license</li> 
        <li>shared with the public, with full access for anyone</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Both conditions must be fulfilled in order for a document to be available for cloning.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/cloning-modal.png")">

      <p>
        Select a document from the list. Click the button labeled <strong>Clone to my workspace</strong> 
        that appears at the top right of the screen. Cloning may take a while. Once the process has 
        finished, you will find the document in your workspace.
      </p>

      <h2>Navigating the Network</h2>
      <p>
        When cloning a document, the information about where you cloned the document from (and when) 
        will be kept.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/link-to-clone-source.png")">

      <p>
        In the annotation view, the info box at the top will automatically show a link to the original, if the
        document was cloned from another source. Likewise, the annotation view of the original document will 
        display a small label showing the number of clones that exist.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/link-to-clones.png")">

      <p>
        Clicking the label will reveal the list of links to the clones, so you can navigate to them.
      </p>
