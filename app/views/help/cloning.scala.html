        The <strong>Clone</strong> feature allows you to create a copy of another user's document
        in your own workspace. The copy includes all the annotations from the original, but 
        is otherwise independent from the source. Think of cloning as a way to build on the work 
        that other users have created and shared, without the risk of breaking or interfering with
        anything.

      <h2>How to Clone</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit another user's workspace, you will see a list of documents. There are two
        possible reasons for why the documents are visible to you:
      </p>
      
      <ol> 
        <li>the owner has <strong>explicitly shared</strong> them with you</li>
        <li>the owner has declared them to be under an <strong>open license</strong> and
          enabled <strong>public access</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Only the second category - public documents with an open license - are available for
        cloning.
      </p>

      <p class="tip">
        Important: documents are only available for cloning if they are declared to be 
        under an open license, and were configured for full public access in the sharing 
        settings.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/cloning-modal.png")">

      <p>
        Select a document from the list. Click the button labeled <strong>Clone to my workspace</strong> 
        that appears at the top right of the screen. Cloning may take a while. Once the process has 
        finished, you will find the document in your workspace.
      </p>

      <h2>Navigating Connections</h2>
      <p>
        When a document is cloned, the information about where it was cloned from (and when) 
        is kept. You can navigate this connection from the 
        <span class="outline-icon">&#xe86f;</span> annotation view.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/link-to-clone-source.png")">

      <p>
        The page header will automatically show a link to the original if the document
        was cloned from another source. Likewise, when looking at the original document, 
        the header will display a small label indicating how many times the document 
        was cloned.
      </p>

      <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/link-to-clones.png")">

      <p>
        Clicking the label reveals a drop-down list of links to the clones.
