      <h2 id="supported-formats">What kind of documents can I upload?</h2>
      <p>Presently, Recogito supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plaintext .txt files (with UTF-8 character encoding)</li>
        <li>Images in JPEG, TIFF and PNG format</li>
        <li>Images served via <a href="http://iiif.io" target="_blank">IIIF</a> (currently,
          single images only but no collection manifests)</li>
        <li><span class="beta">BETA</span> Spreadsheet data in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" target="_blank">CSV</a>
          format (using comma, semicolon, tab or | as delimiting character, and UTF-8 character
          encoding)</li>
        <li><span class="beta">BETA</span> TEI/XML encoded text. Note that we are still testing
          this feature. It may be unstable for very complex and/or long TEI documents. At the
          moment, files need to have a <strong>.tei.xml</strong> extension in order for Recogito
          to recognize them! <a href="mailto:commons@@pelagios.org">Do let us know</a> if you
          experience any problems.
      </ul>

      <h2 id="user-quota">Can I upload unlimited documents?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no fixed limit to the number of documents you upload. However, standard private
        workspaces are limited to a total size of 200 MB. Please get in touch with us if you need
        more space.
      </p>

      <h2 id="legal">Are there legal considerations to using Recogito?</h2>
      <p>
        UK Copyright Law permits the use of third party material for &quot;private and research study
        purposes&quot;. (Please check copyright or similar laws for your own country!) Uploaded
        documents are hosted in your private workspace, and will be accessible only to you - unless you
        choose to share them with other users. If you have verified that the document is not under
        copyright, you can make it publicly available by ticking the &quot;Visible to all&quot; option
        in your document sharing options. (Please refer to our <a href="/signup">Terms and
        Conditions</a> for additional information.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Copyright is an automatic right. But other licensing arrangements may also apply and you must
        take legal responsibility for adhering to all of them. In particular, be aware that some
        &quot;open&quot; Creative Commons licenses have a &quot;No Derivatives&quot; clause which
        according to most copyright laws includes annotations. You must not make such works public
        within Recogito without prior consent from the copyright owner.
      </p>

      <h2 id="making-data-public">What data is available once I make a document &quot;Visible to All?&quot;</h2>
      <p>
        Once you choose to make a document &quot;Visible to All&quot; via the document sharing options,
        everyone who knows the URL to the document will be able to view it. (There is no need to
        log in to Recogito or have an account on the system.) The following data will be accessible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annotation view</strong>, i.e. the text or image, with annotations included</li>
        <li><strong>Map view</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Annotation stats</strong>, including the stats CSV and JSON download options</li>
        <li><strong>Download options</strong>, i.e. annotation bulk downloads in CSV, RDF, GeoJSON, etc. format</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="concurrent-editing">Can I work with other people at the same time?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, you can work concurrently on the same document with other people. But at present
        you will not be able to see other people's edits in real-time. Changes made by others
        will only be visible after you refresh the page.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-is-linked-data">What is Linked Data and how does it relate to Recogito?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data" target="_blank">Linked Data</a> is a way of
        connecting online resources that have some element in common. In our case, that common element
        is <em>Place</em>: Recogito connects places referenced in documents to online gazetteers and
        makes annotations available to you in a Linked Data format called the
        <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/" target="_blank">Open Annotation Data Model</a>.
        Linked Data is also the method that is used under the hood of Recogito to align and connect
        different gazetteers with each other.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-is-a-gazetteer">What is a gazetteer?</h2>
      <p>To paraphrase from the introductory chapters of
        <a href="http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=808056" target="_blank">Berman,
        Mostern &amp; Southall, <em>Placing Names: Enriching and Integrating Gazetteers</em></a>: Most simply,
        a gazetteer is a list of places. A <em>digital gazetteer</em>, in particular, will often include
        names, coordinates and sometimes feature types for each place. Today, digital gazetteers are
        the basis for much of the spatial search and visualization we all have come to take for
        granted on the Web.
      </p>

      <h2 id="available-gazetteers">Which gazetteers are available in Recogito?</h2>
      <p>The following gazetteers are currently available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org" target="_blank">Pleiades Gazetteer of the Ancient World</a></li>
        <li>Places published by the <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/" target="_blank">Digital Atlas of the
          Roman Empire (DARE)</a></li>
        <li>A <a href="http://github.com/pelagios/recogito2-places-geonames" target="_blank">subset of GeoNames</a></li>
        <li>Places from the <a href="http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/chgis/" target="_blank">China Historical GIS</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="which-gazetteer">How do I know which gazetteer to use?</h2>
      <p>
        Different gazetteers often provide overlapping, but also complementary (and sometimes even
        conflicting) information about places for particular time periods or regions. We recommend that
        you select the gazetteer you feel best reflects the document that you are working on (e.g.
        <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org" target="_blank">Pleiades</a> or
        <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/" target="_blank">DARE</a> for Ancient history,
        <a href="http://www.geonames.org" target="_blank">GeoNames</a> for contemporary material) and
        aim to stay consistent as much as possible throughout the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will add additional gazetteers to Recogito over time. Moreover, we are working actively
        with the gazetteer community to assist in the <em>alignment</em> of gazetteers - which means
        that place references you associate with one gazetteer will automatically become associated with
        relevant places in other gazetteers in Recogito.
      </p>

      <h2>What Named Entity Recognition are you using?</h2>
      <p>
        Presently, our hosted service at <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org">recogito.pelagios.org</a>
        integrates the <a href="http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/" target="_blank">Stanford
        CoreNLP</a> recognition engine, with the default language model for English only. However,
        Recogito features a plugin interface for integrating additional languages and recognition
        engines. Do get in touch with us if you want to work with us on extending Recogito's NER
        capabilities!
      </p>

      <h2 id="roadmap">What's on the roadmap for the future of Recogito?</h2>
      <p>
        Some immediate things we are currently working on include: adding support for TEI/XML-encoded
        texts, enhancing support for CSV data tables, and enabling import for IIIF collection manifests.
      </p>

      <h2 id="citing-recogito">How can I cite Recogito in a publication?</h2>
      <p>Please list our URL and the time you accessed it, as in the following example:</p>

     @defining(new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("d MMMM yyyy", java.util.Locale.US)) { dateFormat =>
        <blockquote>
          Recogito, an initiative of Pelagios Commons,
          <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/">http://recogito.pelagios.org/</a>
          (accessed @dateFormat.format(new java.util.Date()))
