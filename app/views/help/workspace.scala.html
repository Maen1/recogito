    Introducing our new document management interface

      <p>
        We recently updated our document management interface. The
        <strong>new workspace</strong> brings more than just a fresh look. It 
        introduces a number of additional features and navigation enhancements.
      </p>

      <h2>What's New?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Folders:</strong> create folders and sub-folders to organize 
          your documents into collections.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Folder readmes:</strong> add descriptive text to your 
          folders to serve as a guide or welcome message to others.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Drag-and-drop import:</strong> upload files by simply
          dragging and dropping them into your workspace. Works for 
          IIIF manifest links, too!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Configurable NER:</strong> Named Entity Recognition is now 
          available for multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German
          - for now). You can also select which gazetteers Recogito should use
          for geo-resolution.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Table customization:</strong> got a huge monitor? 
          Or a small tablet? No problem - choose the metadata that appears 
          in the document list to suit your needs and screen size. 
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>More table column types:</strong> to complement the configurable
          table view, we added new column types you can add to your workspace - such as 
          the <strong>Verification Ratio widget</strong>, which shows the rate of 
          verified vs. unverified annotations.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Grid layout:</strong> bored with the table view? Check out
          our new grid layout.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Activity Statistics:</strong> your recent activity at a glance - as a 
          small chart widget in your workspace sidebar.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Collaborator Quicklinks:</strong> see who you've been annotating with most 
          recently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Guided Tour</h2>
      <p>
        Some of the things you might be familiar with from the old document management interface
        now work in a slightly different way. Here's quick guided tour of key features of the new
        user interface.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <h3>Import documents</h3>
      <p>
        Click the <strong>New</strong> button in the sidebar - or simply drag and drop one or more 
        files into the document pane. Keep in mind that if you upload multiple files, Recogito will 
        create one document with multiple parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        To import an image document served via <a href="https://iiif.io/" target="_blank">IIIF</a>,
        either pick the corresponding option from the <strong>New</strong> menu and paste the URL, 
        or drag and drop the manifest link into the workspace. You can import manifests for single 
        images as well as presentation manifests.
      </p>

      <h3>Create a new folder</h3>
      <p>
        Click the <strong>New</strong> button and select the <strong>Folder</strong> option. Enter a name 
        for the folder. You can always change the name of an existing folder later on, by clicking on it 
        in the table view.
      </p>

      <h3>Add a folder description</h3>
      <p>
        Click the <span class="icon">&#xf055;</span> <strong>Add a description</strong> link above the 
        document pane. Descriptions support 
        <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Markdown 
        syntax</a> for styling and links. You can edit or remove existing descriptions by clicking the 
        <span class="icon">&#xf040;</span> icon at the top right.
      </p>

      <h3>Customize the document table</h3>
      <p>
        You can configure the columns that appear in your document table and their order. Click the 
        <span class="icon">&#xf141;</span> icon on the right edge of the table header. This will open 
        the column configuration dialog. Pick the columns you want to appear on the left. Change the 
        order by dragging the boxes on the right.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>Toggle document presentation</h3>
      <p>
        Switch between a table and a grid view of the document list by clicking the
        <span class="icon">&#xf00a;</span> / <span class="icon">&#xf0c9;</span> icon
        at the top right of the screen.
      </p>

      <h3>Named Entity Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        In the previous version of Recogito, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was a selectable option 
        available during document upload. With the new workspace user interface, two things 
        have changed about this:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          the old three-step &quot;upload wizard&quot; has been removed. Documents are now created 
          instantly when you import them. NER is now available as a separate option you can (re-)run 
          on existing documents.
        </li>

        <li>
          the new workspace provides additional configuration options for NER.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>To run NER on a document</strong> select i, and open the <strong>Options</strong> menu using 
        the blue button above the document pane. From the options, pick <strong>Named Entity Recognition</strong>.
        Choose your preferred recognition engines and gazetteer choice using the NER configuration dialog. 
      </p>

      <h2>Need help?</h2>
      <p>
        We are hard at work improving and extending the functionality of the workspace. If you 
        encounter problems, have suggestions or feature requests, please
