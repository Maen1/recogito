        Apart from a complete facelift and navigation enhancements (such

      </p -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Folders:</strong> organize your workspace into folders 
          and sub-folders.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Readmes:</strong> add descriptive text to your 
          folders to serve as a guide or welcome message.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Drag-and-drop import:</strong> upload files by simply
          dragging and dropping them into your workspace. Works for 
          IIIF manifest links, too!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Configurable NER:</strong> Named Entity Recognition is now 
          available for multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German
          - for now), and you can choose the gazetteers Recogito should use
          for geo-resolution.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Customizable document table:</strong> got a huge monitor? 
          Or a small tablet? No problem - choose the metadata that appears 
          in the document list to suit your needs and screen size. 
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>More table column types:</strong> to complement the configurable
          table view, we added new column types to add to your workspace - such as 
          the <strong>Verification Ratio</strong> showing the rate of verified vs. unverified 
          annotations.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Document grid view:</strong> bored with the table view? Check out the 
          our new grid view.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Activity Statistics:</strong> your recent activity at a glance - as a 
          small chart widget in your workspace sidebar.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Collaborator Quicklinks:</strong> see who you've been collaborating most 
          recently in your workspace sidebar.
        </li>
