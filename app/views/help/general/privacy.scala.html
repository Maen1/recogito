      <h2>1. Storage of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        Recogito stores personal information only to the extent required for providing a functional
        annotation system, as described in our
        <a href="@controllers.help.routes.HelpController.tutorial()">tutorial</a>. We store:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>Personal name (optional, only if you choose to provide one)</li>
        <li>User E-Mail address</li>
        <li>Uploaded documents</li>
        <li>Annotations added to the documents by users</li>
        <li>Edit statistics for documents, derived from the annotations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This data remains stored on Recogito until you delete your account. You can delete your
        account permanently and immediately from your
        <a href="@controllers.my.settings.routes.AccountSettingsController.index()">Account Settings</a>
        page.
      </p>

      <h2 id="email">2. E-Mail Address</h2>
      <p>
        Your E-Mail address is used for the purpose of sending out instructions for resetting
        your password in case you forget it. We will not share your address with anyone, nor
        send out information on a regular basis (newsletters, etc.) We may, however, get in
        touch with specific important or urgent information, should the need ever arise.
      </p>

      <h2 id="visit-tracking">3. Site Visit Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        Like most Websites, Recogito tracks site visits to determine the number of people
        using our service. Although we record data such as device, internet browser and operating
        system, none of this information personally identifies you.
      </p>

      <h2 id="cookies">4. How We Use Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Recogito uses a cookie in order to remember when you are logged in. This prevents you
        from having to log in every single time you visit a new page. It also enables you to
        access your own documents and those that others have shared with you. The cookie
        is cleared from your computer when you log out. Recogito does not use any third party
        tracking or analytics cookies.
      </p>

      <h2 id="your-rights">5. Your Rights as a User</h2>
      <p>
        As a user, you have the right to demand that we disclose the personal information that
        we store about you. Under the terms of the <strong>EU General Data Protection
        Regulation 2018 (GDPR)</strong> you are furthermore entitled to demand that we correct or
        delete personal data about you, or otherwise limit or revoke your permission to us to process
        it. If you want to exercise those rights, or have any questions about them, please contact
        <a href="mailto:@adminEmail">@adminEmail</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you believe that this service violates data protection laws in any way, you can
        file a complaint at a regulating authority. In Austria, the relevant authority is the
