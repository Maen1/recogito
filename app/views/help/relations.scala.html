        The <strong>Relations</strong> tool enables you to draw connections between annotations
        in a text, and tag the connection in order to make a statement about its type.

      </p>

      <h2>How to Use the Relations Tool</h2>
      <p>
        Switch to <strong>Relations</strong> annotation mode in the toolbar. To start a
        connection, click on an annotation once (or click and hold if your prefer). Move the
        mouse to the target annotation and click again (or release the mouse, if you started
        by click-and-hold).
      </p>

      <p>
        Type a tag into the editor box that pops up and hit <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm and
        create the connection. Alternatively, click the <span class="icon 14px">&#xf00c;</span>
        checkmark icon. If you want to cancel and delete the connection instead, hit
        <strong>Escape</strong> or click the <span class="icon 14px">&#xf014;</span>
        trashcan icon.
      </p>

      <h2>Exporting Relations Data</h2>
      <p>
        Recogito can export relation data to multiple formats. Go to the downloads
        page <span class="outline-icon">&#xe875;</span>
      </p>

      <h3>Network Exports</h3>
      <p>
        If relations exist in your document, the downloads page includes an additional box
        with network-specific download options. Currently, there is only one option: CSV node and
        edge lists compatible with the <a href="http://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi</a>
        graph visualization platform.
      </p>

      <p class="tip">
        Note that each network node corresponds to one <strong>annotation</strong>. If you annotate
        multiple occurences of the same place in the text, then each will be a node in the graph. We
        may offer aggregated exports later, where occurrences are grouped, so that each
        <strong>place</strong> is represented as one node, even if annotated multiple times.
      </p>

      <h3>Embedded Exports</h3>
      <p>
        In addition, relations are also embedded into the TEI export, represented as
        <code>&lt;relation&gt;</code> elements in the document header.
      </p>
